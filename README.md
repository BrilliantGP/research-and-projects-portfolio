# Academic & Engineering Portfolio

This repository serves as a collection of my **completed and ongoing** academic research, technical reports, and engineering design projects.  
It consolidates reports, presentations, posters, CAD documentation, and links to related media (photos, videos, simulations).  
The repository will be continuously updated with future projects.
