# Gas of Different Molar Mass on the Thrust Performance of DIY Ion Thrusters

This investigative pre-university report explores how the **molar mass of different propellant gases** affects the thrust performance of small-scale, DIY ion thrusters. The study applies principles from **plasma physics, gas dynamics, and aerospace propulsion engineering** to experimentally evaluate performance trade-offs.

## Abstract
This research investigates:
- **Ion thruster design and build** – Construction of a simple grid-type ion thruster using accessible materials.  
- **Propellant selection** – Comparative testing of gases with varying molar masses.  
- **Thrust measurement** – Use of a sensitive balance to record micro-thrust output.  
- **Performance correlation** – Relationship between molar mass, exhaust velocity, and ionisation efficiency.  
- **Theoretical basis** – Application of electric propulsion fundamentals and the ideal rocket equation.  

The findings confirm that **lighter gases enable higher exhaust velocities**, while heavier gases can provide greater impulse per ion but at lower exhaust speeds.  

## Notes
This was a **pre-university experimental research project**, reflecting early exploration into aerospace propulsion concepts.
