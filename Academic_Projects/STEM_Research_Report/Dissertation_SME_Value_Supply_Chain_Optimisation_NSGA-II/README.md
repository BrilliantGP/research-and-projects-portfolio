# Value-Driven Supply Chain Optimisation for SMEs (Industry 4.0 → 5.0, NSGA-II)

This report presents a value-driven approach to optimising SME supply chains during the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. It integrates **multi-objective optimisation (NSGA-II)** with practical SME constraints to balance cost, delivery performance, and resilience, aligning technical improvements with human-centric and sustainability objectives.

## Abstract
This analysis covers:
- **Multi-objective optimisation with NSGA-II** – Modelling trade-offs among cost, delivery time, and system resilience; exploration of Pareto-optimal solutions.  
- **SME-aware simulation** – Parameterisation and assumptions reflecting typical SME workflows, resources, and data availability.  
- **Industry 4.0 → 5.0 integration** – Mapping digital enablers to human-centric, sustainable value metrics for decision support.  
- **Hybrid performance metrics** – Combining lean/efficiency KPIs with value-based indicators (flexibility, adaptability, stakeholder outcomes).  
- **Implementation pathway** – Practical, modular roadmap for adoption under budget and capability constraints; discussion of TRL and change management.  
- **Results and insights** – Pareto fronts, convergence behaviour, and sensitivity highlights to inform actionable choices under conflicting objectives.

## Example Code
The included `nsga2_demo.py` script produces a simple 2-objective Pareto front (e.g., **minimise Cost** and **minimise (1 − Resilience)**).
