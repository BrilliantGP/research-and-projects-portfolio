# Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Control of an Inverted Pendulum

This investigative pre-university report documents the **modelling, simulation, and control** of an inverted pendulum system using the **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** optimal control method. The project integrates **mechanical dynamics, control theory, and embedded systems engineering** to stabilise a naturally unstable system.

## üìù Abstract
The work investigates:
- **System modelling** ‚Äì Nonlinear dynamics derived via the Euler‚ÄìLagrange method.  
- **State-space representation** ‚Äì Linearisation of the system and Jacobian analysis.  
- **Control design** ‚Äì LQR formulation with systematic tuning of weighting matrices.  
- **Simulation studies** ‚Äì MATLAB-based closed-loop simulations of transient and steady-state responses.  
- **Experimental validation** ‚Äì Arduino-based implementation with actuator and sensor feedback.  
- **Performance analysis** ‚Äì Comparison of predicted and experimental results, including disturbance rejection.  

This project demonstrates how **optimal control principles** can be applied to a classical unstable system, blending theory with practical hardware implementation.  

## üî¨ Notes
