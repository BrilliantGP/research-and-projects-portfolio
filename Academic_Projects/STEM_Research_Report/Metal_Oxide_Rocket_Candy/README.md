# Effect of Metal Oxide Enthalpy on Rocket Candy Energy Release

This pre-university report investigates how the **standard enthalpy of formation of metal oxides** influences the exothermic energy release of a potassium nitrate–sucrose (KNSU) propellant, using **bomb calorimetry** to compare aluminium, magnesium, iron, tin, and copper metal additives. The study connects thermochemistry (Ellingham reasoning) to experimental measurements (q = m·c·ΔT) to explain observed performance differences across metal fuels. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📝 Abstract
This analysis covers:
- **Research question & hypothesis** – Whether metals with more exothermic oxide formation yield greater heat release in KNSU combustion, observable via bomb calorimetry. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Thermochemical basis** – Use of **enthalpy of formation** and Ellingham-style reasoning to frame expected trends across Al, Mg, Fe, Sn, Cu. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Method & instrumentation** – DIY bomb calorimetry with water temperature logging, controlled propellant formulation, and data extrapolation to approximate instantaneous peak temperature. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Variables & controls** – Fixed oxidiser–fuel ratio, constant propellant mass and additive percentage, consistent liquid, volume, and timing window to ensure fair comparisons. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Findings** – Correlation between **more negative oxide formation enthalpy (per O₂ basis)** and **higher measured heat release**; aluminium and magnesium mixtures generally exhibit the strongest energy output, with rationale for deviations discussed. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Uncertainty & limitations** – Heat losses and apparatus constraints acknowledged; uncertainty propagation reported for ΔT, q, and derived formation enthalpies. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

Overall, the work offers a clear experimental link between **thermochemical properties of metal additives** and **propellant energy output**, providing a practical reference for additive selection in small-scale rocketry and educational combustion studies. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
