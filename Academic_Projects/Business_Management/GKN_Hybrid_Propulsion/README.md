## üìù Abstract
This analysis covers:
- **Propulsion architectures** ‚Äì Series, parallel, and turbo-electric hybrid systems compared for efficiency, scalability, and reliability.  
- **Energy storage** ‚Äì Battery technologies, specific energy limitations, and thermal management challenges.  
- **Aero-structural considerations** ‚Äì Mass distribution, integration into aircraft structure, and aerodynamic impact.  
- **Environmental assessment** ‚Äì Projected reductions in CO‚ÇÇ and NO‚Çì emissions aligned with aviation decarbonisation targets.  
- **Feasibility and readiness** ‚Äì Technology readiness levels, cost implications, and adoption challenges.  

This work synthesises engineering theory with industry case analysis to provide insights into the **viability, trade-offs, and pathways** for adopting hybrid propulsion in commercial and regional aviation.

## ‚ö° Example Code
The included Python script demonstrates how hybridisation levels can impact CO‚ÇÇ emissions using a simplified model.  
It generates a **plot of CO‚ÇÇ savings versus hybridisation percentage**.  

```bash
python co2_savings_curve.py
