# 3D Printed Quadruped Robot

This personal project explores the design and prototyping of a **3D printed quadruped walking robot**.  
The aim was to investigate mechanical design, gait control, and low-cost actuation strategies for four-legged locomotion using hobby-grade servos and custom 3D-printed parts.

## Overview
The project focuses on:
- **Mechanical structure** – 3D printed frame and linkages for lightweight but durable assembly.  
- **Actuation** – Servo-based joint control for walking and turning maneuvers.  
- **Control** – Arduino-based gait programming for stability and repeatability.  
- **Testing** – Basic walking and turning sequences validated on flat surfaces.  

This project served as an introduction to **robotics prototyping**, combining CAD design, 3D printing, and embedded programming for a functional quadruped robot.
