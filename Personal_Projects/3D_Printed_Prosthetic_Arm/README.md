# Low-Cost EMG Prosthetic Arm with Touch Sensing and Sign Language Translation

This project explores the design and development of a **low-cost, 3D-printed prosthetic arm**.  
The arm integrates **EMG (electromyography) control**, **touch sensing via capacitive sensors**, and a companion **mobile application that translates text into sign language**.  
The design was based on the open-source **InMoov** model by Gael Langevin, adapted for affordability, durability, and extended functionality.

## Abstract
This project was conducted as part of the **IB MYP Personal Project** with the following objectives:
- Design a prosthetic arm that is affordable (below **$1000**) while maintaining **durability** and **practical usability**.  
- Implement **EMG control** to allow muscle signals to actuate the prosthetic fingers.  
- Add **touch sensors** using conductive foam and copper foil for tactile sensing.  
- Create a companion app capable of **translating text into sign language**, enhancing accessibility.  
- Ensure the device is **environmentally sustainable**, with PLA-based 3D prints and reusable components.

## Key Features
- **3D Printing:** Prosthetic components manufactured using PLA filament for low cost and biodegradability.  
- **Electronics Integration:** Arduino-based control system for EMG and touch sensor processing.  
- **Capacitive Touch Sensors:** Foam-based resistive system for pressure detection.  
- **Mobile App:** Converts written text into **ASL sign language animations**.  
- **Low-Cost Approach:** Total expenditure remained within project constraints, significantly below commercial alternatives ($5k–$200k).  

*This project highlights how open-source hardware, low-cost electronics, and accessible fabrication can democratize advanced prosthetic technology.*
