# Hybrid Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) with Dual-Axis Solar Tracking

This report, authored by Brilliant Gustavo Purnawan, Ruairi Kavanagh, Muhammad Borhan, Margarita Simpson, Muhammad Yusman, Hanif Mohd Fadhillah, and Andhika Nathanael Djajadi presents the design, analysis, and prototyping of a **hybrid renewable energy system** combining a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) with a dual-axis solar tracking mechanism. The project integrates aerodynamic modelling, structural design, and mechatronic control to optimise energy capture in varying environmental conditions.

## üìù Abstract
The work investigates:
- **Aerodynamic optimisation** of VAWT blade geometry under fluctuating wind conditions.  
- **Solar tracking system** with dual-axis actuation for maximising photovoltaic efficiency.  
- **Structural and CAD design** of integrated hybrid platform.  
- **Control system design** for synchronising wind and solar subsystems.  
- **Feasibility analysis** of hybrid energy systems in small-scale and off-grid applications.  

The project demonstrates the potential of combining **distributed wind and solar power generation** within a single hybridised platform to improve resilience, adaptability, and total energy yield in real-world conditions.
