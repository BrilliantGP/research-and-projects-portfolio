# UoM Robotics Society – Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Project

This project, developed by Brilliant Gustavo Purnawan and fellow members of the UoM Robotics Society, focused on the **design, prototyping, and testing of a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)** for underwater applications. The work combined mechanical design, electronics integration, and control system development to produce a functional ROV platform.

## Abstract
The project covers:
- **Mechanical design** – Frame structure optimised for buoyancy, hydrodynamics, and modularity.  
- **Propulsion system** – Multi-thruster configuration enabling 3D manoeuvrability.  
- **Electronics integration** – Waterproof housing for motor controllers, sensors, and power systems.  
- **Control and communication** – Tether-based remote operation with live video feedback.  
- **Testing and validation** – Pool trials to evaluate stability, mobility, and responsiveness.  

This work showcases the interdisciplinary approach needed for **marine robotics**, blending mechanical engineering, control systems, and embedded electronics to develop a robust ROV platform for academic and experimental use.
