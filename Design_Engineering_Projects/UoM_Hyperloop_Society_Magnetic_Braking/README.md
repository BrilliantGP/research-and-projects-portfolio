# UoM Hyperloop Society Magnetic Braking System Development

This portfolio, compiled by Brilliant Gustavo Purnawan and the UoM Hyperloop Society Magnetic Braking Team, documents the design, simulation, and prototyping of an **eddy current magnetic braking system** for hyperloop applications. The project integrates theoretical modelling, CAD design, and experimental testing to evaluate braking performance in high-speed conditions.

## Abstract
The work investigates:
- **Eddy current braking theory** applied to high-speed pods.  
- **Magnetic array design** for maximising braking force while reducing mass and drag.  
- **Thermal management** of eddy currents in conductive rails.  
- **CAD modelling and simulation** of magnetic-rail interactions.  
- **Prototype fabrication and testing** with scaled rigs and measurement of stopping forces.  

This project demonstrates the feasibility and challenges of applying **contactless magnetic braking** in hyperloop systems, highlighting trade-offs between safety, efficiency, and system integration in future sustainable transportation technologies.
