# Design of a Novel Biaxial Loading Fixture Integrated Into Uniaxial Testing Machines

This report documents the design and validation of a **biaxial loading fixture** that mounts to a standard uniaxial testing frame to enable **tension–tension, compression–compression, and tension–compression** testing of cruciform specimens at configurable loading ratios (±1 and ±0.5). Conducted by **Brilliant Gustavo Purnawan, Andhika Djajadi, Yuriy Kim, Magzhan Koshkarov, and Sam Koplickat**, the project integrates mechanical design, CAD, and test methodology to deliver a modular, laboratory-ready solution.

## Abstract
This analysis covers:
- **Selection & evaluation** – Weighted selection matrix and justification leading to the final concept.
- **Fixture architecture** – Four **V-shaped beam** modules arranged on orthogonal axes, interlinked via **NSK rails and sliders** to transfer load symmetrically across the cruciform specimen.
- **Machine integration** – Custom adapters for the **Zwick/Roell Z250 (Type 2)**, including anti-rotation features (clevis pins, shaft key/keyway) to preserve specimen alignment.
- **Configurable loading ratios** – Pin-jointed **angle-locking hinges** with engraved angle indicators enabling ±1 and ±0.5 ratios (e.g., **45° / 63.43° / 26.57°** configurations) for TT/CC/TC modes.
- **Instrumentation** – Integration of an **S-type load cell** and **dual extensometers** per axis for force and strain measurement; hard-limit switches to protect travel.
- **Grippers** – Wedge-action tensile grippers with guided rails, limiter pins, and serviceable spindle assemblies for reliable clamping and repeatable setup.
- **Sustainability & usability** – Modular sub-assemblies, reconfigurable geometry, and robust alignment features to support repeatable testing and reduced downtime.

The resulting fixture enables **biaxial material testing on standard uniaxial machines** with precise, repeatable load paths and field-serviceable components, providing a cost-effective route to multi-axial characterization without a dedicated biaxial frame.
